This WORKING repository contains my contributions to the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition:
  
<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted>
  
This repository uses R code to audit, cleanse, rework and model predictions for Titanic survivors. There are three R scripts in this repository:
- '01_Titanic_Audit.rmd': R Markdown file using "knitr" package to explore and describe the Titanic dataset [in progress]
- '02_Titanic_Munge.R': R script to audit, cleanse and create new variables [in progress]
- '03_Titanic_Model.R': R script with various models to predict surivivors of the Titanic disaster [in progress]
  
Submissions using this code form part of the Kaggle team below:
